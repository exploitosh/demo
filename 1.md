**Nmap — Part 1: Install, Run & Read Output (Beginners)**

`Yo guys, welcome back to TirthSec — where we don’t just talk about cybersecurity, we do cybersecurity.
Today, we’re kicking off the Nmap series — the real foundation of network scanning and recon. So grab your Kali, and let’s start`

`“Before we even start — this is important — only scan systems you own or have written permission to test. Don’t go scanning random websites or networks. Keep your learning clean and ethical.”`

`“Alright, so what actually is Nmap?
Nmap stands for ‘Network Mapper’.
Think of it like a digital radar for networks — it pings around and tells you who’s online, which doors are open — meaning ports — and what kind of services might be running behind them.
It’s one of the first tools every pentester learns because it’s fast, flexible, and super powerful once you know how to use it.”`

`“If you’re using Kali Linux, Parrot OS, or any security-focused distro — good news — Nmap is already preinstalled.
But if you’re using Ubuntu or Debian-based systems and don’t have it, just run this command:”`


# Target length

~10–13 minutes

# Channel stinger / short intro (0:00 — 0:04)

`[Stinger] Yo — welcome back to TirthSec. Real stuff. No fluff.`

---

# Full script (teleprompter style — read naturally)

0:04 — 0:18 — Warm opening
“Hey guys — today we’re starting the Nmap series. I’ll show you how to run some basic scans, and more importantly — how to **read** and **understand** the output. That’s the part most people skip. Let’s go.”

0:18 — 0:28 — Quick legal line
“Quick reminder: only scan systems you own or have written permission to test. Don’t be an idiot.”

---

## Install & quick check (1:00)

(On-screen / terminal)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nmap
nmap --version
nmap --help
```

Say: “If `nmap --version` prints a number, you’re ready. `nmap --help` shows flags — don’t memorize them, we’ll use a few.”

---

## Before running: what the output looks like (say this)

“Before we run scans, a heads up — Nmap prints a few things repeatedly: host reports, port lines (open/closed/filtered), service names, and sometimes OS or traceroute info. I’ll show each one and explain what it means.”

---

## COMMAND 1 — `nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org` (run & explain) (1:30 — 4:00)

Say on camera: “We’ll use `scanme.nmap.org` — a public test host provided by the Nmap project. Run this:”

```bash
nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org
```

### Typical output (abridged example) — show this on screen and read bits

```
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-26 11:00 IST
Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)

...
```

### Explain each part (speak after showing snippet)

* `Nmap scan report for ...` — that’s the host Nmap scanned. Could be IP or hostname.
* `Host is up (0.02s latency)` — the host responded; you can reach it and the number is the response time.
* `Not shown: 995 filtered ports` — Nmap skipped printing filtered ports; it’s saying most ports didn’t show open — they were filtered (firewall) or closed.
* The **PORT** table:

  * `22/tcp  open  ssh  OpenSSH 7.9p1 ...` — Port 22 is open, service detected as SSH, and Nmap guesses the version. That tells you a real service is listening.
  * `80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.38` — HTTP server running and Nmap found the server type/version.
* `MAC Address` — only shows on local networks; helps fingerprint vendor.
* `Device type / Running / Aggressive OS guesses` — Nmap is trying to guess the OS; it’s not perfect but useful.
* `TRACEROUTE` — Nmap shows the path packets took; helpful to see network hops.

Say on camera: “So when you run `-A`, expect detailed info: open ports, services, version guesses, and an OS hint. Use it in your lab or on scanme — not on random targets.”

---

## COMMAND 2 — `nmap -v -sn 192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8` (4:00 — 5:20)

Say: “This one is host discovery only. Run it only on networks you control.”

```bash
nmap -v -sn 192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8
```

### Typical output (abridged)

```
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-26 11:10 IST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.5
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.12
Host is up (0.0032s latency).
Nmap done: 65536 IP addresses scanned in 125.00 seconds
```

### Explain:

* Each `Nmap scan report for <IP>` line shows a host that answered.
* `Host is up (0.0010s latency)` — the machine responded; latency helps judge responsiveness.
* No port info is printed because `-sn` doesn't check ports — it just asks who’s alive.
* At the end, Nmap summarizes how many IPs were scanned and how long it took.

Say: “Use `-sn` to get a list of live devices quickly before scanning ports. It’s lighter and faster.”

---

## COMMAND 3 — `nmap -v -iR 10000 -Pn -p 80` (5:20 — 6:30)

Say: “This picks random IPs and checks port 80. Don’t run it on the internet from your home — it scans strangers.”

```bash
nmap -v -iR 10000 -Pn -p 80
```

### Example output snippet

```
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-26 11:20 IST
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 203.0.113.45
Nmap scan report for 203.0.113.45
Host is up (0.050s latency).
PORT   STATE  SERVICE
80/tcp open   http
...
```

### Explain:

* `Discovered open port 80/tcp on <IP>` — Nmap found an HTTP server on that random IP.
* Then it prints the host report similar to before.
* Important: scanning random machines can trigger abuse reports and is unethical without permission.

Say firmly: “Don’t run this unless you’re in a lab or you have permission.”

---

## BASIC COMMANDS & WHAT THEIR OUTPUT LOOKS LIKE (6:30 — 9:00)

I’ll list each command, a tiny example output, and what that output means — so you can teach people how to read results.

### `nmap -sT <IP>` (TCP connect scan)

Example output snippet:

```
PORT   STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp open   ssh
80/tcp open   http
```

Explain: `open` means a service answered a full TCP connection. `-sT` is simple and works without sudo.

### `sudo nmap -sS <IP>` (SYN scan)

Output looks similar, but scan is faster. Explain: same `open/closed/filtered` states — `-sS` requires sudo because it uses raw sockets.

### `sudo nmap -p 22,80,443 <IP>`

Output shows only the ports you asked for. Explain: use when you already suspect which services to check.

### `sudo nmap -p- <IP>` (all ports)

Output will list all open ports found (maybe lots). Explain: scans 1–65535 — longer.

### `sudo nmap --top-ports 100 -sS -sV <IP>`

Output will show top ports and attempt versions:

```
PORT   STATE  SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open   ssh     OpenSSH 7.4
80/tcp open   http    nginx 1.14
```

Explain: quick, effective scan that often finds the important stuff.

### `sudo nmap -sV <IP>` (version detection)

Output includes `SERVICE` and `VERSION` columns. Explain: version helps you decide which vulnerabilities to research next (in lab only).

### `sudo nmap -oA myscan <IP>`

This creates `myscan.nmap`, `myscan.xml`, `myscan.gnmap`. Explain: keep these files. `.xml` can be imported by tools and `.nmap` is a human-readable log.

### `sudo nmap -Pn <IP>`

If output shows ports but you previously had hosts show no ping, `-Pn` forces port checks, useful when pings are blocked.

### `sudo nmap --reason <IP>`

Example:

```
PORT   STATE    REASON
80/tcp open     syn-ack
23/tcp filtered no-response
```

Explain: `REASON` tells you why Nmap labeled a port the way it did — `syn-ack` means received SYN/ACK; `no-response` means firewall or filter.

### `sudo nmap --traceroute <IP>`

Output includes a TRACEROUTE section showing intermediate hops and RTTs. Explain: shows network path to the target.

---

## INTERPRETING COMMON PORT STATES (9:00 — 9:45) — teach this clearly

Show and say:

* `open` — the service answered; you can connect. Example line: `80/tcp open http`.
* `closed` — host is up but nothing is listening on that port. Example: `23/tcp closed telnet`.
* `filtered` — probes were blocked or dropped; Nmap can’t tell if port is open. Example: `443/tcp filtered https`.
* `open|filtered` / `closed|filtered` — ambiguous states for some scan types — use another scan or flags to clarify.

Say: “If you see `filtered`, try `--reason` or `-Pn` or a different scan type to investigate further in your lab.”

---

## PRACTICAL TEACHING EXERCISE (9:45 — 10:15)

On camera say:
“Quick exercise you can ask viewers to do:

1. `nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org` — watch the open ports and service names.
2. `nmap -v -sn 10.226.198.0/24` — list live hosts on your Wi-Fi.
3. `sudo nmap --top-ports 100 -sS -sV <one-live-ip>` — inspect services and versions.
   Ask them to paste the `open` ports and the service names in the comments — I’ll reply to some.”

---

## Closing (10:15 — 10:40)

“Alright — that’s Part 1. You now know how to run basic Nmap scans and, more importantly, how to read the output — what ‘open’, ‘filtered’, `syn-ack`, service names, and OS guesses mean. In Part 2 we’ll use these results to run safe web checks and directory scans in the lab. If you want the printable cheat sheet pinned below, smash like and I’ll drop it. Subscribe and I’ll see you in Part 2. TirthSec — practical cybersecurity, no fluff. Peace.”

If you want I’ll now:

* convert this to a **one-page teleprompter file** (no timestamps, just clean lines to read), **or**
* make a **printed cheat sheet** that shows each command and the exact output examples you can screenshot, **or**
* produce the **Part 2 script** that takes a found HTTP host and runs gobuster / nikto / sqlmap examples (lab-only).

Pick one and I’ll drop it instantly.
